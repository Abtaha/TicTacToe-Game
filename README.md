# 2048 Game

This repository contains the code for both the **GUI** and **Logic** for the TicTacToe game.

## Features

The **GUI** can be used in multiple ways.

- This uses the same GUI file as in `https://github.com/Abtaha/2048-Game`
- The number of rows and columns can be changed.
- The color coding can be *enabled* or *disabled*.
- The GUI is resizeable and reactive

The **Logic** can be changed so that different keys may be used.

## Usage

To run the game simply launch the `TicTacToe.py` program.

- Both *windows* and *linux (debian based)* programs are available.
- For *windows*, simply download the `TicTacToe.exe` file to run it.
- For *linux*, download the `tictactoe.deb` file and install it to run the game. (You must run it through the cmd by typing `TicTacToe`)
